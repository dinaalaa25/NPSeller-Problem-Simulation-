# NPSeller Problem Simulation 
 Simulation for newspaper seller's problem.
 This project focuses on maximizing the profit of a newspaper seller by determining the optimal number of newspapers to purchase each day. The seller deals with four types of days (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor), each 
 with specific probabilities of occurring. Newspapers are bought for 50 cents and sold for 70 cents, with unsold papers sold as scrap for 15 cents each. The project evaluates how the number of newspapers, their 
 selling price, and bundle size affect profitability, using statistical methods to analyze daily profits and determine the optimal purchasing strategy.
